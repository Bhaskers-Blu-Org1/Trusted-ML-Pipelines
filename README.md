# Building a secure and transparent ML pipeline using open source technologies
The application of AI algorithms in domains such as criminal justice, credit scoring, and hiring holds unlimited promise. At the same time, it raises legitimate concerns about algorithmic fairness. There’s a growing demand for fairness, accountability, and transparency from ML systems. And we need to remember that training data isn’t the only source of possible bias and adversarial contamination. It can also be introduced through inappropriate data handling, inappropriate model selection, or incorrect algorithm design. We need a pipeline that’s open, transparent, secure, and fair, and that fully integrates into the AI lifecycle. Such a pipeline requires a robust set of bias and adversarial checkers, debiasing and defense algorithms, and explanations.

Animesh Singh, Svetlana Levitan, and Tommy Li demonstrate how to build an ML pipeline that’s open, secure, and fair and that fully integrates into the AI lifecycle, using open source tools like AIF360, ART, Model Asset Exchange (MAX).

## Get Started 
- Sign up for free IBM Cloud account: http://ibm.biz/oscon2019
- Watson Studio:  https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/


## Instructions
### 1. Create a Jupyter notebook on Watson Studio or on the local machine
To start with this tutorial, we need to first get an instant of Jupyter notebook running either on the Cloud using Watson Studio or on the local machine. To set it up on Watson Studio, go to https://github.com/IBM/pytorch-on-watson-studio to follow all the steps to learn about how to create a Notebook on Watson Studio and use it to train and test a MNIST PyTorch Model

### 2. Run the ART, AIF360, ML Pipeline Notebook
Go to the [second pharse](notebooks) where we will go over how to use ART, AIF360, and ML Pipeline using Jupyter notebook.
